    "# 4. Functions\n",
    "## 4.1 Introduction\n",
    "Last lesson I said that we would delve into purposeful programming. That involves user input, and user input requires a thing called functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are functions? Well, in effect, functions are little self-contained programs that perform a specific task, which you can incorporate into your own, larger programs. After you have created a function, you can use it at any time, in any place. This saves you the time and effort of having to retell the computer what to do every time it does a common task, for example getting the user to type something in.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.2 Using a Function\n",
    "Python has lots of pre-made functions, that you can use right now, simply by 'calling' them. 'Calling' a function involves you giving a function input, and it will return a value (like a variable would) as output. Don't understand? Here is the general form that calling a function takes:<br>\n",
    "`function_name(parameters)`\n",
    "\n",
    "See? Easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Function_name` identifies which function it is you want to use (You'd figure...). For example, the function `raw_input`, which will be the first function that we will use.\n",
    "- `Parameters` are the values you pass to the function to tell it what is should do, and how to do it... for example, if a function multiplied any given number by five, the stuff in parameters tells the function which number it should multiply by five. Put the number 70 into parameters, and the function will do 70 x 5."

    "## 4.3 Parameters and Returned Values - Communicating with Functions\n",
    "Well, that's all well and good that the program can multiply a number by five, but what does it have to show for it? A warm fuzzy feeling? Your program needs to see the results of what happened, to see what 70 x 5 is, or to see if there is a problem somewhere (like you gave it a letter instead of a number). So how does a function show what is does?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, in effect, when a computer runs a function, it doesn't actually see the function name, but the result of what the function did. Variables do the exact same thing - the computer doesn't see the variable name, it sees the value that the variable holds. Let's call this program that multiplied any number by five, `multiply()`. You put the number you want multiplied in the brackets. So if you typed this:\n",
